# 📊 Project 1: Superstore Sales Analysis

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship with [Coding Samurai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coding-samurai/)**.  
The goal was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world retail dataset to derive business insights and build a foundation in data storytelling.

## 🧠 Objective

Analyze historical sales data from a US-based superstore to uncover patterns in revenue, profit, discount impact, and customer behavior across regions, categories, and time.
