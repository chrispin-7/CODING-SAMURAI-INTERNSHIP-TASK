# 📊 Project 2: Linear Regression on Advertising Data

This project explores the relationship between advertising spend and product sales using a Linear Regression model. We used the classic "Advertising" dataset to analyze how TV, Radio, and Newspaper budgets influence sales performance.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Exploration
2. Correlation Analysis
3. Visualizations (scatterplots, heatmap)
4. Model Building (Linear Regression)
5. Evaluation (R² = 0.91, RMSE = 1.71)

## 🔍 Insights
- **TV & Radio** ads significantly drive sales.
- **Newspaper** ads have minimal effect.
- Our model explains ~91% of sales variance.
